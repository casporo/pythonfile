General Introduction:
Welcome to my GitHub repository. To summarise, this repository contains machine learning models that I have explored and used throughout my research work.

----- Machine Learning Models -----
In this repository, I have included the following machine learning algorithms. The algorithms are located in ML-Algo folder.
1) Artificial Neural Network (classified as neuralnetwork.py)
2) Decision Tree (classified as decision_tree_classification.py)
2) Linear Regression (classified as linear_regression.py)
3) Multiple Regression (classified as multipleregression.py)
4) Naive Bayes (classified as naive_bayes.py)
5) Polynomial Regression (classified as polynomialregression.py)
6) Random Forest (classified as randomforest.py)
7) Support Vector Machine (classified as svm_classification.py)
Sidenote: When running decision tree and random forest, you will notice a few images being generated. These images are to show how the trees came about with the solution / reading.

---- Folder Architecture ----
The repository is divided into the following folders
1) CGKS Algorithms - My Masters work involving machine learning
2) ML-Algo -  Machine learning models that I have explored
3) Plot Files - Python Plot Files

---- How to Run the Machine Learning Models  ----
1) Select a machine learning model
2) Right click and run the file.
3) If needed

Additional Notes:
1) Currently, the machine learning models are all classification-based models.
2) Python configuration is required for your IDE.
3) Python libraries require installation through terminal.
